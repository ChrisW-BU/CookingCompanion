This prototype is the foundation of a meal preparation aid for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It uses a linear structure for the recipe process, which allows a users to digest one event at a time. The idea is that this acts as a way of maintaining some spatial awareness of the task, and augments a persons prospective memory with functions such as alarms and timers.

Although this particular study has not involved any target stakeholders, it has been tested with a non-MCI user group to establish a performance baseline and ensure that all current functionality works as intended. The hope is that this study can inform any future work with MCI users, and further develop the idea.
